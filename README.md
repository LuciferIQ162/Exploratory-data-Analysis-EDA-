# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) README

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** as a foundational step in the data science lifecycle. EDA systematically investigates and summarizes the main characteristics of a dataset, employing both statistical summaries and graphical visualizations. The primary goal is to gain a thorough, unbiased understanding of the data, identify potential issues, and inform further analytical or modeling processes with clarity and precision.

## Objectives

- Provide an in-depth examination of data distributions and main characteristics.
- Identify and visualize key relationships, patterns, and trends within the dataset.
- Detect and analyze outliers, missing values, and anomalies that could impact downstream modeling.
- Assess data quality and integrity to guide cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Generate actionable insights and form well-supported hypotheses for subsequent analysis.

## Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion and Initial Review**
   - Load the dataset and examine its structure, types, and preliminary statistics.
   - Document the shape of the data and sample entries to establish context.

2. **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**
   - Compute and interpret summary statistics (mean, median, range, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for numerical variables.
   - Evaluate categorical features using frequency counts and mode analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualize single features using histograms and
